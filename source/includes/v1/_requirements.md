# Requirements

There are 2 requirements for using the Datafeedr API.

## 1. API Keys

You will need a set of Datafeedr API keys which can be [purchased here](https://members.datafeedr.com/subscribe).

Datafeedr API keys consist of an **ACCESS ID** and an **ACCESS KEY** which must be included in all API Requests.

See the [Usage Limits](#usage-limits) section for more information on API Request limits.

## 2. Affiliate IDs

You can make Requests to the Datafeedr API without affiliate IDs but in order [insert your affiliate IDs](#inserting-affiliate-id) into the affiliate URLs, you will need to:

- have an account at any affiliate network you want to promote products from
- be approved by any merchant you want to promote products from

Without a valid affiliate ID you will not receive commissions for referred sales.
